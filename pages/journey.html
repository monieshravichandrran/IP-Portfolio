            I spent nearly 10 years at DAV and it was one among best portions of
            my life. With fear of new school and new friends I spent a good time
            there. I completed my X<sup>th</sup> with a 10 CGPA and took
            Computer Science group for XII<sup>th</sup>. I was a passioante
            coder and love to take CS group arose in my minds much earlier. I
            completed my XII<sup>th</sup> with a 94%. The teachers I came across
            in DAV were a gem and their advice has always been a motivation in
            my life there on.

            The most excited phase of a students life is the college life. Me
            after completing XII<sup>th</sup> was eager to join in college. I
            applied to SSN with a cutoff of 190 and got a CSE seat there. Made
            new friends and we used to study and play in college. The COVID was
            a changer in our life which forced us to stay indoors

            I attended several interns that came to the campus and couldn't make
            it to the list of the students shortlisted in my college. I decided
            there to improve my skills and concentrated in Competitive
            Programming, Web Development, App Development and Blockchain. I
            actually grew as a developer in this period.

            This month was quite a special month in my life. I was not a great
            developer at this period and I just tried to participate in City
            Command Maps and Location Hackathon conducted by Mitsubishi, NEC And
            Here APIs. I spent my time sincerly on this hackathon and just
            learnt more and get well versed in MERN Stack. We won the 2nd runner
            up place worth a price of 50K INR building our project the MPS Maps
